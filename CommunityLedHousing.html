									<h2>Community led housing  </h2>

									<p>Community led housing includes a variety of models such as cohousing, community land trusts (CLTs), community self-build, development trusts, housing co-operatives, self-help housing, tenant management, mutual home ownership, almshouses and potentially other new innovative models. It includes new build, renovation of existing buildings and regeneration and it can operate across any tenure â€“ home ownership, shared ownership and market, affordable and social rented homes</p>

									<h3>Housing co-operative ownership</h3>
									<p>Housing co-operative ownership is a type of home ownership where a group of people collectively own and manage the housing in which they live. In a housing co-operative, each member is a shareholder in the co-op and has an equal say in decision-making. 
Here are some key features of housing co-operative ownership:
Shared ownership
Instead of owning their own unit, members own shares in the co-op as a whole. 
Shared decision-making
Members have an equal say in decisions about the co-op, such as rent, repairs, and who joins or leaves. 
Shared responsibility
Members are expected to take an active role in managing the co-op. 
Shared resources
Members can share resources like vehicles and washing machines, which can reduce ecological impact and costs</p>

<p>In a housing cooperative, common spaces are shared by the members of the cooperative, who are also the tenants:</p>
<p>Ownership: In a cooperative, the property is owned by the group of members, not by any one person. Each member is a shareholder in the cooperative and has an equal say in decision-making</p>
<p>Management: The members are responsible for managing the property, including paying for expenses, loans, and mortgages</p>
<p>Rent: The rent paid by tenants reflects the cost of managing the property</p>
<p>Shared spaces: The members share common spaces in the property</p>
